    <h2>MetaCOG model demos</h2>
    <p>The gif below shows the outputs of the object detector Faster R-CNN on one of the scenes from our dataset, rendered in the simulation environment ThreeDWorld:<p>

    <p>These faulty object detector are input into the MetaCOG model, which uses Spelke object principles (e.g., object permanence) to infer which objects are where.<p>
    <p>Here are MetaCOG's  inferences on this scene:<p>

    <p>These results are not unique to Faster R-CNN. Here's Retinanet on another scene: <p>

    <p>And are MetaCOG's  inferences on this scene:<p></p>
    <img src = "Demos_folder/metacog_retinanet_scene36.gif" alt = "metacog_retinanet_scene36" class="center">

    <p>With experience, MetaCOG builds a metacognitive representation of the object detector's performance -- that is, what the detector tends to miss and hallucinate -- so as to make better inferences over time. This is all done without any feedback about the ground-truth object labels.<p></p>
