			<p>Hi! I'm a postdoc at MIT's <a href="https://yangtan.mit.edu/icon/">Integrative Computational Neuroscience (ICoN) Center</a>. I study how we think about our own and other minds. I'm especially interested in how we make inferences about the unobservable things going on in other people's minds, like what they are thinking about or how much pain they are experiencing. To approach these problems, I use a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling. </p> 
			<p>I did my PhD at Yale University in the <a href="https://compdevlab.yale.edu/">Computational Social Cognition Lab</a> at Yale University under the supervision of Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger. </p>
			<p>Before Yale, I was a <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/education/college-scholar-program/">College Scholar</a> at Cornell University and spent a summer in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hakwan-lau-lab">Hakwan Lau's lab</a> at UCLA. </p>
