<h1>Women's Health Advocacy</h1>

<p>At the same time as pursuing my academic career, I have also been a patient struggling to 
access medical treatment for a chronic gynecological pain condition that I didn't even know existed. This experience has exposed me to a reality that few people know about: the crisis in healthcare for women's pain.*</p>
	
*The pain conditions that I will be discussing may affect anyone with female anatomy, regardless of gender identity. Because of the relevant societal and historical connotations, I am be using the term “women,” but I really mean “people with vaginas.”

<p>Despite the prevalence of chronic vulvar, vaginal, and pelvic pain conditions (affecting up to 28% of American women at some point in their lives; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24080300/")>Harlow et al., 2014</a>, 
most medical providers, and even heavily credentialed gynecologists, do not know about the existence of these conditions, much less how to diagnose and treat them. 
These conditions are highly stigmatized and receive little public attention or awareness, and because of this, many people suffer in silence, blaming themselves for pain they and their doctors don’t understand. 
The recent New York Times Serial podcast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/podcasts/serial-the-retrievals-yale-fertility-clinic.html">The Retrievals</a> details recent events at The Yale Fertility Center, where an “untold number of women [...] suffered unimaginable terror and pain” <a href="https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Yale-Complaint.pdf")>Cowan v. Yale, 2021</a>
undergoing invasive procedures conducted without any anesthesia or pain management. The podcast does an amazing job outlining the larger pattern of dismissal and pathologizing of women’s pain in medical settings.</p>

<p><b>As psychologists and scientists, we have a unique role to play in compensating for our field's history</b> of promoting the harmful view of women’s vulvar, vaginal, and pelvic pain as originating from the psyche rather than from treatable medical conditions <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jah/article/109/4/782/7109655?login=false")>Srajer, 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Set to this background, during my PhD at Yale, I’ve built a coalition of patients, medical providers, researchers, and other allies to change this reality.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the actions that I have taken:</p>

<p>- Organized the New Haven chapter of <a href="https://www.tightlipped.org/">Tight Lipped</a> and collaborated with Yale's OBGYN department to ensure that residents receive some education about chronic vulvovaginal pain conditions.</p>

<p>- Penned an <a href="https://cornellsun.com/2023/09/23/guest-room-the-disturbing-failures-in-gynecological-care-at-cornell-health/">Op Ed</a> detailing my experiences seeking care for chronic gynecological pain while a student at Cornell University, and calling for the University to address the problems in gynecological care at its student health center.</p>

<p>- Testified in the Stakeholder Perspectives session of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/assessment-of-nih-research-on-womens-health">Assessment of NIH Research on Women's Health</a> in January 2024, urging that research on chronic pelvic and vulvovaginal pain condition be identified as a high priority. Historically, the NIH has funded very little research on these conditions, amounting to pennies per patient. The handful of studies that the NIH funded were through the Institute of Child Health and Development.</p>

<p>- Participated as a patient representative from <a href="https://www.tightlipped.org/">Tight Lipped</a> in the 2024 Vulvodynia Summit in Washington, D.C., where I presented on the barriers to care for chronic vulvovaginal pain conditions and the urgency of the need for accessible treatments. There are still no FDA approved treatments for chronic vulvar pain ("vulvodynia"), which affects millions of women in America.</p>

<p>I was eventually (eight years after first seeking treatment) able to receive the surgery that I needed and get it covered under my health insurance plan. Receiving life-changing surgery should not require the level of education, perservence, energy, and luck that I had. I am determined to change this, and to use my current and future positions and institution affiliations to help advance this change.</p>
